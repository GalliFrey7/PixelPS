This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.


# Deployment on Vercel

I chose Vercel to deploy my project because it is a quick and easy way to make my applications available on the internet.

## Deployment Process

1. **Authorization on Vercel:** Signed up for Vercel and logged into my account on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com).

2. **Installing the CLI:** Installed the Vercel CLI to be able to manage my projects from the command line.

3. **Initializing the project:** Went to the directory with my project and executed the `vercel init` command to start the deployment process.

4. **Project selection:** Selected the project that I wanted to deploy on Vercel.

5. **Configuring deployment settings:** Specified the necessary parameters, such as the project name and domain name.

6. **Deployment:** After completing the configuration, started the deployment process by running the `vercel` command.

7. **Deployment Tracking:** Watched the deployment process in the console and got the URL of my deployed application.

8. **Additional settings:** Configured additional deployment parameters in the `vercel.json` file, including routes and environment settings.

9. **Project Update:** After making changes to my project, just ran the `vercel` command to update the deployed application on Vercel.

Now my project has been successfully deployed on Vercel and is ready for use. This process was quick and painless thanks to the simplicity and intuitive Vercel platform.
